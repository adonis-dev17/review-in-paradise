# JavaScript Practice Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript practice repository! ðŸš€

In this repository, I explore the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, functions, and loops. Whether it's understanding data types, writing efficient functions, or mastering control flow, you'll find it all here.

## Contents

- `variables/`: Examples of variable declarations and assignments.
- `functions/`: Implementations of various functions, from simple to complex.
- `loops/`: Demonstrations of loops (such as `for`, `while`, and `forEach`).

Feel free to dive into the code, learn from it, and contribute if you'd like! Let's strengthen our JavaScript skills together. ðŸ’ª

Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ”¥
